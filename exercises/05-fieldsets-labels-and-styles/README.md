# `05` Fieldsets, Labels and Styles


Styling a form is boring and tedious, but if you use certain tags you life can become more easy.

```
<labels>
```
One of the tipical things you need to do is add a "Label" to your input, lable's tell the end-user what the input stands for.

```
<fieldsets>
```
Are ideal to add several inputs into the same logical group (for example grouping to radios -male and female- into a gender fieldset).

```
<legend>
```
Is the name of the fieldset group that is going to be shown to the end-user.


## üìù Instructions:

1) Make the font beautiful by applying this font to the body:
font-family: "Lato", sans-serif;

2) Remove borders and margins from all the fieldsets. Apply a padding of 10px to the top and bottom and a padding of 0px to the left and right. Apply a font weight of 800.

3) Decrease the font-weight off all the lable's to 400

4) Apply these rules to all the text inputs
```js
input[type=text] {
	border: none;
	border-bottom: 1px solid black;
	font-size: 16px;
}
```

5) Apply this style to the submit button
```js
input[type=submit] {
  cursor: pointer;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #f65252;
  color: white;
  width: 100%;
}
```

The result should look like this:
