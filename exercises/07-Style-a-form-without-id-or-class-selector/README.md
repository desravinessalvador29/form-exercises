# `07` Style a Form Without ID or Class Selector

Here you have a beautiful signup form, you can read the code to understand how it was made.

## üìù Instructions:

Replace all the .class and #id selectors from index.css and replace them with other types of selectors to accomplish the same reference. For example:

For this html:
```js
<div><a class="myAnchor">Here is an anchor</a></div>
```

Instead of doing
```js
<style>
.myAnchor{ background: red; }
</style>
```

Your could do
```js
<style>
a{ background:red;}
</style>
```

The only class selector you can keep using is ".active"

At the and your form needs to look exactly the same as the original one, like this:
