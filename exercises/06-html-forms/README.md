# `06` HTML5 Forms

## üìù Instructions:

HTML5 brings some more cool tricks to forms, here is a few:

1. We are using placeholders to help the user understand how to fill each specific input.
2. There is now a input type=email, use it on the form.
3. There is now a input type=tel, use it on the form for the phone number.
4. There is now a input type=url, use it on the form for the website
5. You can use a required attribute to make it mandatory, apply the required attribute to the email only (the form won't submit until is not empty).
6. Using autofocus attribute will focus the cursor in that particular input when the website load. Apply the autofocus attribute to the email.
